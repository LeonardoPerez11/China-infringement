        <center><p class="lit">I believe that China's infringement lawsa are too strict and should be make a little less strict. I get the idea that if there is 0 room for anyone to copy anything then there will always be new content, but i believe that content is something that should be built upon and the first version should not be the last. Other people could see ideas that they could buiild off of but in with those kinds of infrigement laws, then there could not be that innovation.</p></center>
